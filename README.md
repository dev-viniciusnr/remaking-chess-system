# Remaking Chess System

This repository contains a remake of my original chess system developed in Java.  
The goal of this remake is to revisit the logic and structure of the original project, applying improvements in code clarity, organization, and design patterns where possible.

By rebuilding the project from scratch, I'm reinforcing core concepts of **object-oriented programming** and practicing clean architecture while maintaining the functionality of a fully playable terminal-based chess game.

> This is part of my continuous learning process as I evolve in Java backend development.
